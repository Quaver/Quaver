# Configuring skin.ini
Sometimes the default configuration for skins may not be good enough and you want to adjust them. By making a `skin.ini` file in the root directory of the skin folder, you are allowed to manipulate some of the values to change the look of the game.

## General ##

The `[General]` section of the config file contains metadata about the skin - who it's by, what it's called, and the version. It's mainly to let people know what your skin is all about.

| Value | Data Type | Notes |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Name | String | The name of the skin |
| Author | String | The creator/author of the skin |
| Version | String | The version number of the skin |

## Keys ##

This section is to manipulate the elements for the Keys game mode including 4K and 7K.

* To start manipulating elements for 4K, create a section in the file titled `[4K]` and have all of your config properties under it.
* To start manipulating elements for 7K, create a section in the file titled `[7K]` and have all of your config properties under it.
