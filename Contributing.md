# **Contributing**
A guide for how to contribute to Quaver if you aren't familiar with Git, GitHub, source control, or open-source projects.


## **What you need**
- A GitHub account (https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver)
- A Git client
    - GitKraken is a great multi-platform Git client, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    - Windows only: Git Extensions work well.
    - Alternatively, the Git command line is always an option.
- C# IDE (if you intend on modifying code)
    - Windows only: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or newer


## **GitHub Account Setup**

### **Forking**


The first step for new contributors is to fork the Quaver repository. Forking creates a copy of the repository that belongs to your GitHub account. They are free to make any changes to their repository, having no effect on the Quaver repository. At a later point they may ask to create a pull request to merge their changes to the Quaver repository. This does not put any code on your machine, so the next step is to start using git.
