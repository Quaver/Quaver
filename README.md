# Status
Quaver is still under development and should not be used for gameplay, and is only intended for developers only. While we do provide builds for users, expect there to be bugs and things not working. Any feature requests should be opened in the [issues](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver/issues).

# Requirements
* Unity 5.0+
* .NET 2.0+

# Contributing 
We're welcoming all contributions to our game, however please keep in mind that we might have privatized assets that will most likely be mixed in our code, so if you are eager to help, this is a challenge you'll have to face. Contributions can be made via a pull request to this repository. Any contributors shall have their names mentioned in our [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) file. 

Also, please note that our code is not perfect, but we do have certain standards in place for how we organize our code. It is best to follow those same practices unless you find something completely wrong with it - which in that case we are open for suggestions.

The best place to start contributing is by joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nJa8VFr). All of our main developers, contributors, and testers are in there, and is the best place for collaboration.
