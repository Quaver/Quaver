# Status
Quaver is still under development and should not be used for gameplay, and is only intended for developers only. While we do provide builds for users, expect there to be bugs and things not working. Any feature requests should be opened in the [issues](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver/issues).

# Requirements
* C# Compiler 
* Monogame 3.6
* .NET 4.5
* Up to date and initialized submodules

# Submodules
The entire Quaver client is built from a series of class libaries. As such, we have included them as submodules. Please note that some submodules may not be open-source. Aside from that, the following submodules are as such:

* [Quaver-API](https://github.com/Swan/Quaver-API) - Library containing code revolving around map/replay parsing and difficulty calculation.

You can install these submodules by simply running `git submodule update --init --recursive`
