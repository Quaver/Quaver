# Contributing 
We love and encourage people to contribute to Quaver - whether it be through code, designs, or ideas. Our mission is to provide a space where the rhythm game community's voice is able to be heard. We're aiming to create the ultimate vertical scrolling rhythm game, and this isn't possible without community input.

The best place to begin contributing to Quaver is through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nJa8VFr), where all of our developers, community, and testers are located.

Any contributions can be made through opening a pull request. When contributing however, please keep in mind that there should only be one branch/pull request per feature. This means if your branch is titled `my-new-feature`, you shouldn't have any unrelated commits, and the same system is applied to pull requests. Please make sure to keep your pull requests short and concise.

If you are wanting to develop a feature with the goal of having it being in the Steam release, open up an issue first, so we can discuss if it is in the scope of what we are trying to accomplish.

When contributing, please remember to follow our [code style](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/blob/master/CODESTYLE.md), so the codebase is consistent across the board. If you have any issues with our approaches to structuring/styling our code, feel free to bring this up.
