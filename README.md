## About 

**Quaver** is a community-driven and open-source competitive vertical scrolling rhythm game with two game modes and online leaderboards. It also features an in-game editor and a flexible multiplayer mode.

It is also available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/980610/Quaver/) Early Access for Windows, Mac, and Linux—making it one of the most accessible community-driven rhythm games to date.

## Status

This project is currently under heavy development and is in a beta state, however it is extremely playable as a standalone game. Quaver still has a ton of work ahead of it and will continue to get better as time goes on with new features and bug fixes being added each day.

## Features

Although there are many games like this, **Quaver** offers many unique features and expands on the ideas of its predecessors that make it much different. It is also heavily inspired by a variety of our favorite rhythm games.

* **Two Game Modes** - Play the game with 4 keys or challenge yourself with 7. Each game mode has separate global and country leaderboards to compete on.

* **Global & Country Leaderboards** - Compete with your country and the world for the highest scores and aim to be #1.

* **Ranked & Casual Multiplayer** - Challenge up to 16 players in casual or competitive-oriented multiplayer battles. Multiplayer includes three game modes including Free-For-All, Teams, and Battle Royale.

* **Map Editor** - Create your own maps to any of your favorite songs. Upload and share them with the world, and submit them for official ranking.

* **Advanced Skinning System** - Completely customize your gameplay experience with the ability to create skins. Export and share your skins with friends or upload them to the Steam workshop.

* **Replays** - Go back in time by watching your previous scores. Watch replays from other players around the world, or export your own and share them with your rivals.

* **Over 10+ Game Modifiers** - Switch up the way you play by activating in-game modifiers. Customize the speed of the song, get rid of all the long notes, or even randomize the entire map!

* **Steam Achievements** - Become a master of Quaver by completing challenges and earning achievements!

* **Play Maps From Other Games** - Coming from a different game and miss all of your favorite maps? Quaver supports .osz, .sm, and .mc/.mcz files out of the box—with support for more games to be added in the future!
